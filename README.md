# Computer Animation

## About

Learning material for computer animation:
* Animation for Film
* Animation for Games
* VFX
* Motion graphics/design
* Procedural, generative and math animation
* Environment animation (e.g., non-character animation)
  * foliage animation
  * plants animation
  * animating natural phenomena
* Physically based animation
  * fluid animation
  * rigid body animation
  * soft body animation
* Organic animation
* Traditional animation, e.g, hand-drawing or stop-motion animation
* Stylized modeling, rendering and compositing

The aim of these materials:
* Give a map of computer animation
* Teach theoretical background of animation
* Give practical tools and methods for animating

Currently, it is not the aim to give low-level implementation of data-structures and algorithms for animation, rather conceptual understanding of those and using higher-level tools which implement and provide those as well as understanding their parameters and application.

## Structure

The structure of these materials follows:
1. Book: I. kerlow: The Art of 3D Computer Animation and Effects [here](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Isaac-V-Kerlow/dp/0470084901)
2. Lecture: Computer Graphics: Animation and Simulation (Stanford) [here](http://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs348c/)
3. My knowledge and experience :)

The aim of this project: create learning materials for computer animation course.

See [wiki](https://github.com/lorentzo/ComputerAnimation/wiki) for more info.

## Software

* [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
* [Houdini](https://www.sidefx.com/)

Using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for organization.
